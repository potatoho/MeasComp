# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:

# Set RULES here if you want to take build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES=/path/to/epics/support/module/rules/x-y

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
